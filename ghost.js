Create a class Ghost
Ghost objects are instantiated without any arguments.
Ghost objects are given a random color attribute of "white" or "yellow" or "purple" or "red" when instantiated
ghost = new Ghost();
ghost.color //=> "white" or "yellow" or "purple" or "red"
Solution:

let Ghost = function(){
  this.color = ["red","white"."yellow","purple"][Math.floor(Math.random()*4]
}
